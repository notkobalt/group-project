Kira: https://github.com/notkobalt/group-project/commit/d50d806232d38a7a5c0c0c60df651c50d49b3769<br>
1: All material for my lab is located in "kiralab.py" and "kira.html"<br>
2. I created a class called "Calc" which handles calculations.<br>
3. Objects are created when testing numbers with the calculations<br>
4. Values are returned and are able to be displayed on the website<br>
5. [I Miss a point on this, I was unable to figure out why I can't input numbers similarly to the fibonacci website]<br>

Dylan:https://github.com/notkobalt/group-project/blob/main/bulkofproject/classesminilab/dylanlab.py <br>
1: "classesminilab" blueprint contains .py file with mini-lab code <br>
2: class "equations" exists <br>
3: list, dict, dictid, function objects created <br>
4: getters used to pull data from class, [missed point because it does not print the output] <br>
5: [missed point because wow is not highlighted] <br>

Jacob: https://github.com/notkobalt/group-project/blob/e0873bb396498b340c757a025a9f598a94d09f32/bulkofproject/classesminilab/jacoblab.py <br>
1: Code for mini-lab located in jacoblab.py file (contains the class) <br>
2: Defines "Characters" class containing characters from shows or video games. <br>
3: Creates the object from the class "Characters" when displayed. <br>
4: Uses the getters "series, list, dictid and dict"; however I miss a point due to error in print. <br>
5: I failed to try to adding this class on the web and displaying it correctly; missed point. <br>

Lucas: <br>
1: lucaslabnew.py and lucas.html has my relevant lab code<br>
2. created a class titled 'equations'<br>
3. any time you enter a number, objects are made<br>
