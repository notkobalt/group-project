1: All material for my lab is located in "kiralay.py" and "kira.html"<br>
2. I created a class called "Calc" which handles calculations.<br>
3. Objects are created when testing numbers with the calculations<br>
4. Values are returned and are able to be displayed on the website<br>
5. [I Miss a point on this, I was unable to figure out why I can't input numbers similarly to the fibonacci website]<br>

Dylan:https://github.com/notkobalt/group-project/blob/main/bulkofproject/classesminilab/dylanlab.py
1: "classesminilab" blueprint contains .py file with mini-lab code <br>
2: class "equations" exists <br>
3: list, dict, dictid, function objects created <br>
4: getters used to pull data from class, [missed point because it does not print the output] <br>
